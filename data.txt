the funny part is that next is somehow too ahead (pretty cool)

also renders from /pages

components from pages need to use export default!

there is alot abt of spa and static sites so, incremental static generation is a thing on next.

actually theres a lot of rendering methods for each use case (lol?) and is not for each app, IS FOR EACH PAGE FROM THE APP!

C R A Z Y!
